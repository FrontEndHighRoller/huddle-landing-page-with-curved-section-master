## 👀 Why This Project Stands Out

- Built from an official **Frontend Mentor real-world challenge**
- Fully responsive landing page with **curved SVG sections**
- Uses the `<picture>` element to **serve different images based on device size**
- Performance-friendly approach with **no JavaScript**
- Clean, modern UI with strong typography and spacing
- Demonstrates attention to **accessibility, responsiveness, and scalability**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Semantic markup and accessible structure  
- **CSS3** – Flexbox, media queries, custom properties (CSS variables)  
- **Responsive Images** – `<picture>` and `srcset` for device-based image switching  
- **Google Fonts** – Poppins & Open Sans  
- **Font Awesome** – Social media icons  
- **Frontend Mentor Design Assets**

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to implement **responsive images** using `<picture>` and media queries
- Structuring HTML for **complex landing page layouts**
- Managing **SVG backgrounds and curved sections**
- Writing **scalable, maintainable CSS**
- Using **CSS variables** for consistent theming
- Improving **performance** by serving optimised assets per screen size
- Translating a detailed design mockup into a polished, responsive UI

> 📌 This project was an excellent exercise in responsive design and performance optimisation, especially learning how to switch images based on screen size without relying on JavaScript.
